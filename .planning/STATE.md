# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-18)

**Core value:** Generate a seamlessly-looping WAV file from a mix of calming sounds that can be dropped straight into a video editor.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Web Audio API for synthesis (no copyright risk, runs in-browser)
- Hybrid approach: AudioWorklet for noise, CC0 samples for weather/ambient
- OfflineAudioContext for WAV export (must match live AudioContext sample rate exactly)
- No backend — local-only tool running on localhost via Vite dev server
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Lazy AudioContext singleton with getContext/ensureRunning pattern — sampleRate 44100 pinned to prevent Phase 4 resampling artifacts
- [Phase 01-foundation]: AudioWorklet files must live in public/worklets/ (static assets) not src/ — Vite would bundle src/ files breaking addModule()

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: CC0 sample acquisition for rain/wind/thunder requires manual license verification — budget extra time; Content ID disputes take weeks
- Phase 2: Pink and grey noise IIR filter coefficients are MEDIUM confidence — validate aurally during implementation
- Phase 4: OfflineAudioContext worklet re-registration behavior across multiple exports in one session should be tested empirically
